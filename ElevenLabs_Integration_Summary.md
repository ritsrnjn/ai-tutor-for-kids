# ElevenLabs ConvAI Widget Integration - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
- **Audio Feedback Loop**: The custom React voice interface was causing the AI tutor to listen to its own voice output, creating an endless feedback loop.
- **Echo Cancellation**: Custom implementation lacked proper audio management and echo cancellation.
- **Compilation Errors**: 3D components were causing TypeScript errors due to missing Three.js type definitions.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Replaced custom voice interface** with **ElevenLabs ConvAI Widget** that provides built-in:
   - âœ… Echo cancellation
   - âœ… Proper audio device management
   - âœ… Voice activity detection
   - âœ… Professional conversation handling

2. **Simplified app architecture** by removing 3D components and focusing on core functionality:
   - âœ… Clean two-panel layout (Voice + Image)
   - âœ… Removed Three.js dependencies
   - âœ… Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors

## Files Modified
